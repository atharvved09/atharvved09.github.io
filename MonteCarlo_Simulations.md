<h2>Monte Carlo Simulations</h2>

<p>This page will host Monte Carlo experiments demonstrating sampling distributions and statistical properties of the evolutionary process. For now, here's a simple placeholder that explains the intended content.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run repeated trials to observe fixation probabilities.</li>
  <li>Visualize distributions of outcomes and convergence statistics.</li>
  <li>Compare different population sizes and initial frequencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you'd like, I can add an interactive Monte Carlo demo similar to the others — would you prefer a histogram, repeated runs visualization, or both?</p>
